# parabola_drawer
A simple program to draw parabolas usng straight lines! I found some code here[http://www.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse20211/fall2011/gfx] that makes line drawing in X11 easy. I know this works on my arch linux system, might also work on a mac.

# usage
To use, compile example.c then run the executeable. First, the code will prompt you to enter the number of lines to draw. Start
with 20. Then it will accept the first letter of a color to draw with. After this has been enetered, click on 4 points in the x 
window to draw the parabola. Color choices are {b)lue, (g)reen, (r)ed, (m)agenta, (c)yan, (o)range, (y)ellow, (p)urple, and 
(w)hite.

# Copying
Fell free to copy this code, but I would appreciate some credit! ALso, do not forget to acknowledge the work of Douglas Thain, this 
project would not be possible without his code.
